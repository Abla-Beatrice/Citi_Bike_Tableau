* ***Analysis***

With the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), Citi Bike share multiple actions to support riders, associates, and city partners - including asking asking our community to follow recommendations from local and federal health experts.

There were many phenomena to be uncovered.
Citi Bike is struggling to keep up with a coronavirus-induced ridership spike,
the number of cyclists crossing the East River bridges has doubled since the beginning of March and Citi Bike has seen a 70% increase in tripS.

After creating and analyzing my visualization, I realize that the most popular start times are at 11 AM and 7 PM. Most used bikes are often started on around the same stations and increasing the amount of bikes to these areas will allow more users to have a bike available.

On standard weekday commutes, there are typically 45% more evening commuters than morning commuters. During COVID, this trend has become even more pronounced, with more than twice as many evening trips.

Citi Bike also proved itself to be an essential commuting option during this year, and offered free annual memberships to healthcare workers during the coronavirus crisis in response to the increased usage of the docks outside city hospitals. The previously announced expansion into upper Manhattan and the Bronx has continued as well, despite the pandemic.

Another analysis is that most of the riders are between the ages of 25 and 40 with a median age about 33. 
CitiBike users are mainly womens.
